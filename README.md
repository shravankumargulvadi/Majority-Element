# Majority-Element

Majority rule is a decision rule that selects the alternative which has a majority,that is, more than half the votes. Given a sequence of elements 𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, you would like to check whether it contains an element that appears more than 𝑛/2 times. The naive way of doing this is a quadratic algorithm. Your goal is to use the divide-and-conquer technique to design an 𝑂(𝑛 log 𝑛) algorithm.
